This code snippet is focused on performing a linear regression analysis on a dataset. Here is a general breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports**:
    - Various libraries are imported including `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and specific modules from `sklearn`.

2. **Data Loading**:
    - Data is loaded from a file named 'data.txt' into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - The columns of the DataFrame are named as 'one', 'two', and 'three'.

3. **Data Preparation**:
    - The independent variables (X) and dependent variable (y) are separated from the dataset.
    - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

4. **Model Building**:
    - A Linear Regression model is instantiated.
    - The model is trained on the training data (X_train, y_train).
    - Predictions are made on the training data.

5. **Visualization**:
    - The shape of the training data and labels are printed.
    - A scatter plot of the training data points and labels is plotted.
    - A line plot of the training data points against the predicted values is also plotted.


6. **Evaluation**:
    - The R-squared score is calculated to evaluate the model's performance on the training data.

Overall, the code aims to load data, split it for training and testing, build a linear regression model, visualize the data and predictions, and evaluate the model's performance using the R-squared metric.
